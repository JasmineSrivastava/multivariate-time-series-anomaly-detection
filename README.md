# Multivariate Time-Series Anomaly Detection

This project detects anomalies in multivariate equipment sensor data using:
- Isolation Forest (machine learning)
- LSTM Autoencoder (deep learning)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- tsfresh
- Jupyter Notebook

## Overview
The dataset is unlabeled, so anomaly detection performance is evaluated
using reconstruction error distribution and visual inspection.
Synthetic anomalies were injected to validate model behavior.
